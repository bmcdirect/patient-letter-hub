# Production Routing Issue Analysis

## Problem
The `/dashboard` route returns 404 in production environment (https://patient-letter-manager-bmcdirect1.replit.app/dashboard) even though authentication is working.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Development Mode**: Working perfectly - Vite dev server handles all routes correctly
2. **Production Mode**: Issue with static file serving and client-side routing

## Current Configuration
- **Development**: `npm run dev` → Vite dev server with hot reload
- **Production**: `npm run build` → `npm run start` → Express static server

## Issue Identified
The production deployment is failing because:
1. Build process might be timing out or failing
2. Static server fallback to index.html not working properly
3. Express server in production mode not handling React Router routes

## Verification
- ✅ Local development routing works (both /dashboard and /nonexistent-route return 200 OK)
- ✅ Authentication system works in both modes
- ❌ Production deployment routes return 404

## Solution Options
1. **Fix Build Process**: Ensure `npm run build` completes successfully
2. **Update Production Server**: Ensure static serving handles client-side routes
3. **Force Development Mode**: Use development mode in production as fallback

## Recommended Fix
Since the `server/vite.ts` file cannot be modified, the issue likely lies in:
1. Build process timing out during deployment
2. Production environment not finding the built assets
3. Express fallback route not properly configured

## Next Steps
1. Test if build completes successfully
2. Verify dist/public directory is created
3. Ensure production server serves index.html for all routes
