Run comprehensive automated testing of the authentication and core functionality after our major architecture changes. We need to verify everything works before manual testing.

CRITICAL TESTING AREAS:

1. **Authentication System Testing**
   - Test all 5 healthcare practice login endpoints
   - Verify session creation and persistence
   - Test logout functionality
   - Check authentication middleware on protected routes
   - Verify tenant isolation in authentication

2. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Test all /api/auth/* endpoints (login, user, logout, practices)
   - Test /api/quotes endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Test /api/orders endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Test /api/practices endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Test /api/dashboard/stats endpoint
   - Test /api/admin/* endpoints (orders, quotes, stats)
   - Verify all endpoints return proper HTTP status codes

3. **Database Connectivity Testing**
   - Test database connection and queries
   - Verify multi-tenant data isolation
   - Test CRUD operations for all major tables
   - Check foreign key relationships
   - Verify data persistence

4. **React Component Testing**
   - Test that all main components render without errors
   - Verify SimpleLogin component displays practice selection
   - Test SimpleDashboard component loads properly
   - Check AdminDashboard component functionality
   - Test navigation between components

5. **Form Submission Testing**
   - Test quote creation form processing
   - Test order creation form processing
   - Test login form processing
   - Verify form validation and error handling

6. **Multi-Tenant Isolation Testing**
   - Test that tenant 1 data is isolated from other tenants
   - Verify user sessions are tenant-specific
   - Test that API calls respect tenant boundaries
   - Check that each practice only sees their own data

7. **Session Management Testing**
   - Test session creation on login
   - Test session persistence across requests
   - Test session destruction on logout
   - Verify session timeout handling

8. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test invalid login attempts
   - Test access to protected routes without authentication
   - Test malformed API requests
   - Verify proper error messages and status codes

9. **File Upload Testing**
   - Test file upload endpoints
   - Verify file validation and security
   - Test file download functionality
   - Check file storage and retrieval

10. **Email System Testing**
    - Test email service configuration
    - Verify email template rendering
    - Test notification trigger endpoints

For each test, report:
- ✅ PASS: Brief description of what worked
- ❌ FAIL: Detailed error message and suggested fix
- ⚠️ WARNING: Issues that work but need attention

Focus on identifying any breaking changes from our recent authentication system overhaul.
