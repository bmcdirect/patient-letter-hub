You‚Äôre picking up exactly where the last fix left off.
We need to wipe out the remaining ‚Äúempty orders + random 500‚Äù problems in one shot.

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks
Back-fill historical orders
Run once, immediately:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE orders
SET    practice_id = tenant_id
WHERE  practice_id IS NULL;
Use the existing Drizzle client (or a db.execute(sql.raw(...))) in a short script server/scripts/backfillPracticeId.ts.

Run the script automatically when the server starts, but guard with WHERE practice_id IS NULL so it‚Äôs idempotent.

Persist sessions across restarts

Add connect-sqlite3 (lightweight, already in Replit image) and configure express-session to use it.

Store the DB file at ./data/sessions.sqlite.

Read SESSION_SECRET from .env; if missing, default to "PLEASE_CHANGE_ME" but log a warning.

Keep the rest of the session options (secure, sameSite, etc.) exactly as they are.

Fix middleware order for uploads

In server/index.ts mount sequence:

session

simpleAuthRoutes

tenantMiddleware

simpleRoutes (which contains /api/orders)

In server/simpleRoutes.ts make sure requireAuth runs before upload.array('file') on the orders POST route.

Smoke-test everything (fail the run if any step fails)

Login as admin@riversidefamilymed.com / password123.

GET /api/orders ‚ûú expect at least one row (practiceId = 1).

Create an order with two files (test.csv, test.pdf) ‚ûú expect HTTP 201 and "practiceId":1.

Restart the dev server (pkill -f "tsx server/index.ts" + start) without logging in again and POST a one-file order ‚ûú expect HTTP 201 (session survived).

Log failures clearly if any assertion fails.

Clean-up & docs

Remove any temporary debug logs you add.

Append a concise changelog to replit.md under ‚Äú‚úÖ Persistent sessions & order back-fill‚Äù.

üîë Acceptance criteria
Historical orders now appear in the orders list right after page load.

Creating orders never returns 500; unauthenticated requests return clean 401.

After a restart, the same browser session can still create an order.

No developer console errors on /orders/create page.

Go!
