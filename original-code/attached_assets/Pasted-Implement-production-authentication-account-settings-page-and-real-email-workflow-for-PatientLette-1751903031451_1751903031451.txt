Implement production authentication, account settings page, and real email workflow for PatientLetterHub:

1. **Real Authentication System:**
   - Replace mock/temp authentication with production user registration/login
   - Password hashing (bcrypt), email verification, password reset functionality
   - Role-based access: admin staff vs practice users
   - Multi-tenant isolation by practice (existing tenant system)
   - Remove all temporary/mock authentication code

2. **Account Settings Page (Basic Structure):**
   - Create /settings route for practice users
   - Basic account information form: Practice name, address, phone, primary contact
   - User preferences: Auto-delete data file setting, notification preferences  
   - User management: List practice staff, add/remove users
   - Basic billing preference: Credit card vs NET terms (dropdown)
   - Save button that updates tenant/user data
   - Professional layout matching existing app design

3. **Real Email Workflow (Using Existing Resend):**
   - Set up all workflow emails to send to actual email addresses
   - Proof ready emails → Customer gets real email with approval link
   - Customer decisions → Admin staff gets real email notifications
   - Order status changes → Real email notifications to customers
   - Invoice generation → Real PDF invoices emailed to customers
   - Configure admin staff email addresses as recipients for notifications

4. **Create 15 Test Practice Accounts:**
   - Generate realistic practice names and information
   - Create login credentials for each (no pre-populated orders/quotes)
   - Set up email addresses that forward notifications to admin staff
   - Varied practice types: medical, dental, veterinary, therapy, etc.
   - Include documentation with all test account credentials
   - IMPORTANT: Store all test data in the database using existing tables, NOT hardcoded arrays

5. **Database Updates:**
   - Update user schema for real passwords and roles
   - Add account settings fields to tenants table
   - Remove mock authentication data structures
   - Add proper user session management

IMPORTANT: Keep existing Resend email configuration - just make emails go to real addresses instead of mock/disabled emails. Admin staff should receive normal emails in their inbox for workflow testing. All test data must be stored in the PostgreSQL database, not hardcoded in frontend components.
