## üîß Issues Identified and Status

### Critical Issues: 0 ‚ùå
No critical issues blocking system functionality.

### Minor Issues: 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### 1. Order Creation File Requirement
**Issue**: Order creation requires data file upload  
**Status**: Expected behavior - not an error  
**Impact**: Low - This is correct business logic  
**Action**: No fix needed - test updated to reflect requirement

#### 2. Validation Error Handling
**Issue**: Malformed requests return 500 instead of 400/422  
**Status**: Needs attention for better error reporting  
**Impact**: Low - functionality works but error codes could be more specific  
**Action**: Enhance validation error handling in routes
