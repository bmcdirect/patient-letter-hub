### 2.3 Status Progression Testing
**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Pending → Draft (Ready for Proof)
- [ ] Draft → Waiting Customer Approval (with proof upload)
- [ ] Waiting Approval → Approved (customer action)
- [ ] Approved → In Progress (admin action)
- [ ] In Progress → Completed (admin action)
- [ ] Completed → Delivered (admin action)
- [ ] Hold/Resume functionality
- [ ] Revision request handling

**Expected Results:**
- No status can be skipped improperly
- Customer approval required before production
- Proper email notifications at each stage

## PHASE 3: SYSTEM INTEGRITY TESTING

### 3.1 Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Create orders under different tenants
- [ ] Verify customers only see their tenant data
- [ ] Verify operations staff see all tenant data
- [ ] Test database queries include tenant_id filters
- [ ] Verify file upload paths include tenant isolation

### 3.2 Authentication and Authorization
**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Customer authentication flow
- [ ] Operations authentication bypass (development mode)
- [ ] Route protection for customer vs operations
- [ ] Session management and timeouts
- [ ] API endpoint security

### 3.3 Email System Testing
**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Order status change notifications
- [ ] Proof ready notifications
- [ ] Invoice generation emails
- [ ] Customer approval notifications
- [ ] Custom email functionality

## PHASE 4: TECHNICAL CLEANUP AUDIT

### 4.1 Debug Code and Console Logs Removal
**Files to Check:**
- [ ] client/src/pages/admin-dashboard-clean.tsx
- [ ] client/src/pages/proof-review.tsx
- [ ] server/routes.ts
- [ ] server/services/*.ts
- [ ] All React components

**Look for:**
- console.log statements
- debug comments
- temporary testing code
- development-only code blocks

### 4.2 Duplicate File Handling Methods
**Areas to Investigate:**
- [ ] File upload endpoints (customer vs admin)
- [ ] File storage patterns in storage.ts
- [ ] File retrieval methods
- [ ] Proof file handling vs regular file handling
- [ ] Download endpoint patterns

### 4.3 API Endpoint Pattern Consolidation
**Review:**
- [ ] Authentication middleware consistency
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Response format standardization
- [ ] Tenant context handling
- [ ] Validation schema usage

### 4.4 Unused Imports and Components
**Files to Audit:**
- [ ] All React component files
- [ ] Server route files
- [ ] Service layer files
- [ ] Shared schema files

## PHASE 5: PERFORMANCE AND UX TESTING

### 5.1 Frontend Performance
**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Page load times
- [ ] Query caching effectiveness
- [ ] File upload performance
- [ ] Real-time updates (30-second intervals)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### 5.2 Database Performance
**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Query efficiency with tenant filters
- [ ] File metadata retrieval speed
- [ ] Order listing performance
- [ ] Search functionality speed

## IDENTIFIED CLEANUP PRIORITIES

### High Priority Cleanup:
1. **Remove Development Logs** - Backend has extensive development logging that should be cleaned
2. **Consolidate File Handling** - Multiple file upload/download patterns exist
3. **Standardize Error Handling** - Inconsistent error response patterns
4. **Remove Unused TypeScript Errors** - Several LSP errors in admin dashboard

### Medium Priority Cleanup:
1. **API Response Standardization** - Some endpoints return different response formats
2. **Component Organization** - Large admin dashboard file could be split
3. **Unused Import Removal** - Several components have unused imports
4. **CSS Class Consolidation** - Repeated styling patterns

### Low Priority Cleanup:
1. **Comment Cleanup** - Remove outdated comments
2. **Variable Naming Consistency** - Some variables use different naming conventions
3. **Function Organization** - Group related functions together

## TESTING EXECUTION ORDER

1. **Start with Customer Workflow** - Ensures end-user experience works
2. **Verify Admin Workflow** - Confirms operations staff capabilities
3. **Test System Integrity** - Validates security and data isolation
4. **Perform Technical Cleanup** - Improves code quality and maintainability
5. **Performance Testing** - Ensures system scalability

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- All customer workflows complete without errors
- All admin workflows function as designed
- No data leakage between tenants
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Performance meets requirements
- Email system fully functional
- File handling secure and efficient

This test plan should be executed systematically before implementing new features to ensure system stability and identify areas needing refactoring.
