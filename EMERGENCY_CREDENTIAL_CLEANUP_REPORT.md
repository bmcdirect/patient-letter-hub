## üìã **Files Modified**

### **Credential Cleanup:**
1. `DEPLOYMENT_READY_SUMMARY.md` - SMTP password replaced
2. `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` - SMTP password replaced
3. `VERCEL_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` - SMTP password replaced
4. `ALIAS_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` - SMTP passwords replaced (3 instances)
5. `ALIAS_SMTP_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - SMTP passwords replaced (2 instances)
6. `DATABASE_CONFIGURATION.md` - Database credentials replaced (3 instances)

### **Security Documentation Added:**
1. `SECURITY_CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT.md` - Comprehensive security guide
2. `EMERGENCY_CREDENTIAL_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - This incident report

## üö® **Immediate Actions Required**

### **1. Credential Rotation (COMPLETED)**
- ‚úÖ SMTP password changed in Microsoft 365
- ‚úÖ New password deployed to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Database password should be rotated (if not already done)

### **2. Security Monitoring**
- [ ] Set up GitGuardian or similar credential scanning
- [ ] Implement automated security alerts
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews
- [ ] Train team on secure credential practices

### **3. Process Improvements**
- [ ] Review all documentation for credential exposure
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for credential scanning
- [ ] Establish security review process for documentation
- [ ] Create incident response procedures

## üìà **Recommendations**

### **Short Term (Next 7 Days)**
1. **Rotate Database Password** - Change database password if not already done
2. **Security Training** - Brief team on credential security practices
3. **Documentation Review** - Audit all documentation for credential exposure
4. **Monitoring Setup** - Implement credential scanning tools

### **Medium Term (Next 30 Days)**
1. **Security Policy** - Create formal security policies and procedures
2. **Access Review** - Audit all system access and permissions
3. **Incident Response** - Establish formal incident response procedures
4. **Security Training** - Implement comprehensive security training program

### **Long Term (Next 90 Days)**
1. **Security Audit** - Conduct comprehensive security assessment
2. **Compliance Review** - Ensure compliance with security standards
3. **Penetration Testing** - Consider professional security testing
4. **Security Culture** - Build security-first development culture

## ‚úÖ **Verification Steps**

### **Repository Security Check:**
```bash
# Search for any remaining exposed credentials
grep -r "Health2025#Data\$Secure!" .
grep -r "Maryland2.*pLh3" .
grep -r "sk_live_" .
grep -r "whsec_" .
```

### **Environment Protection:**
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Confirm no `.env` files in repository
- [ ] Check Vercel environment variables are secure
- [ ] Validate all documentation uses placeholders
