# Rollback Procedure for Authentication Rebuild

## Emergency Rollback (If Issues Arise)

### Quick Rollback to Production
```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Verify we're on the correct commit
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: 6c9689a Debug: Add comprehensive logging to middleware...

# Force push to production (if needed)
git push origin main --force
```

### Complete Rollback (Restore All Files)
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Restore backed up files
Copy-Item "auth-backup/middleware.ts.backup" "middleware.ts"
Copy-Item "auth-backup/session-manager.ts.backup" "lib/session-manager.ts"
Copy-Item "auth-backup/protected-layout.tsx.backup" "app/(protected)/layout.tsx"
Copy-Item "auth-backup/env.mjs.backup" "env.mjs"
Copy-Item "auth-backup/auth-config.client.ts.backup" "lib/auth-config.client.ts"

# Commit restored files
git add .
git commit -m "Emergency rollback: Restore authentication files from backup"

# Push to production
git push origin main
```

## Rollback Verification
✅ **Branch Switching**: Confirmed working
✅ **File Restoration**: Backup files available
✅ **Production Access**: Main branch intact
✅ **Commit Integrity**: Base commit `6c9689a` preserved

## Rollback Triggers
- Authentication completely broken
- Users cannot log in
- Database corruption detected
- Security vulnerabilities found
- Performance degradation > 50%

## Rollback Timeline
- **Immediate**: Switch to main branch (30 seconds)
- **Complete**: Restore all files (2 minutes)
- **Production**: Deploy rollback (5 minutes)

## Safety Measures
- All changes are on isolated branch
- Production remains untouched
- Backup files are preserved
- Rollback procedure is tested and documented
