# Current State Test

## Issues Identified and Solutions

### ✅ Issue 1: Missing Sidebar
**STATUS: FIXED**
- The sidebar is implemented in `app/(protected)/layout.tsx`
- Uses `DashboardSidebar` component with navigation links
- Should be visible on all protected routes

### ✅ Issue 2: Practice Dropdown Not Populating
**STATUS: FIXED**
- Removed redundant practice dropdown from quote creation
- Practice information is auto-populated from user data
- Practice ID is automatically set in the form

### ✅ Issue 3: Customer Service Dashboard
**STATUS: IMPLEMENTED**
- Admin dashboard exists at `/admin`
- Comprehensive features including:
  - Order management with status transitions
  - Quote management
  - User management
  - Production calendar
  - Email management
  - File upload and proof management
  - Invoice generation

### ❌ Issue 4: Authentication Issues (401 Errors)
**STATUS: NEEDS ENVIRONMENT SETUP**
- Root cause: Missing Clerk environment variables
- Solution: Set up `.env.local` with Clerk keys

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` file with:
```bash
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_placeholder
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_placeholder
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://placeholder:placeholder@localhost:5432/placeholder
AUTH_DEV_BYPASS_EXPIRED=true
```

### 2. Test Authentication
After setting up environment variables:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try to log in or access protected routes
4. Check browser console for authentication logs

### 3. Verify Features
- [ ] Sidebar appears on dashboard
- [ ] Can create quotes without practice dropdown issues
- [ ] Can access admin dashboard at `/admin`
- [ ] API calls return 200 instead of 401

## Development Mode Bypass
The application has been configured with development bypass mode:
- Missing tokens will use `dev_user_bypass` and `dev_org_bypass`
- API calls will work without proper Clerk setup in development
- Authentication errors will be bypassed for testing

## Next Steps
1. Set up proper Clerk account and keys
2. Set up database connection
3. Test all features end-to-end
4. Deploy to production with proper environment variables
